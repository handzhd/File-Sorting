# File sorting with UiPath Studio
This is a simple RPA program done when I had some free time and took my time to learn RPA using UiPath. 
This project sorted certain file types and moved them to the appropriate folders. This project was done in my downloads folder where all types of files were just lying around
and I thought that I needed to sort the files by file extension.

# Project description:

First of all, the program will create folders depending on the type of files I want to sort. In this case, there are 5 folders: Zips, MP4, Apps, Images and other files. 
The program will iterate through all the files in the download folder and sort them by file extension type. After that, the program will move the corresponding files into the corresponding folders.
At the end of the iteration, I added an index to count how many files I sorted by their extensions.
